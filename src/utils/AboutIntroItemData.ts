As a creator, you can earn by selling Spores for cash or crypto, and also earn passively from the growing use of on-chain space backed by CKB tokenomics. Holding a Spore doesn't just mean owning a secure asset on an open blockchain, but also the CKBytes allocated during the Spore's creation, signifying a share in CKB's growth. Spore Protocol transforms creators and holders into co-owners, promoting a community-focused income model."
