The Spore secp256k1 example is a collection of code examples written in TypeScript, which help you understand how to use @spore-sdk/core in Node environment to:

<MarginContainer bottom={24} />

- Construct and send transactions of spores and clusters on Testnet (Aggron)
- Use Secp256k1Blake160 lock to sign transactions

<MarginContainer bottom={100} />

# Setup <span style={{color:'#3A5AFF'}}>.</span>

<MarginContainer bottom={48} />

Firstly, you’ll need to clone the repository. Open up your terminal and type in the following command:

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShookLyngs/spore-sdk.git
```

<MarginContainer bottom={32} />

Assuming your spore-sdk is located at `~/projects/spore-sdk` . Make sure to change your terminal’s location accordingly.

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

```bash
cd ~/projects/spore-sdk
```

<MarginContainer bottom={32} />

Then, you can install dependencies with pnpm by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm i
```

<MarginContainer bottom={32} />

After installed, run the following command to build local packages:

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

```bash
pnpm run build:packages
```

<MarginContainer bottom={100} />

<MarginContainer bottom={100} />

# Run an example <span style={{color:'#3A5AFF'}}>.</span>

<MarginContainer bottom={32} />

<img src={RunExample} alt={'run code'}/>

<MarginContainer bottom={32} />

Let's go to the spore secp256k1 examples' directory:

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

```bash
cd examples/secp256k1
```

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

The example code is stored in the apis directory, feel free to review the code or change the data of spore/cluster you want to create on-chain, or even treat the examples as your experimental fields.

<MarginContainer bottom={32} />

To run an example, for instance if you want to create a spore on-chain, you can run the apis/createSpore.ts example in your terminal:

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

```bash
ts-node apis/createSpore.ts
```

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

The example should construct and send a transaction that creates a spore, and after sending the transaction, it should return a `Transaction Hash` for you to view the details of the transaction on CKB Explorer.

<MarginContainer bottom={100} />

<MarginContainer bottom={100} />

# Configuration <span style={{color:'#3A5AFF'}}>.</span>

<MarginContainer bottom={48} />

If you have your own testing accounts, or if you want to configure the SporeConfig of the examples, you can go to the utils/config.ts file and update it. Inside the utils/config.ts file, you can do:

<MarginContainer bottom={16} />

- Update the default testing private keys to your own
- Update the SporeConfig as needed
